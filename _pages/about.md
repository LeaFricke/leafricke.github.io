I am postdoctoral researcher in Tatjana Scheffler's lab for [Digitale Forensische Linguistik](https://staff.germanistik.rub.de/digitale-forensische-linguistik/) at the German department of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum. I work in the project [Semantics and Pragmatics of Emojis in Digital Communication](https://vicom.info/projects/semantics-and-pragmatics-of-emojis-in-digital-communication/), which is part of the priority program [ViCom](https://vicom.info/). In this project, we experimentally investigate the explanatory power of iconic and symbolic approaches to emoji semantics.

I completed my PhD at the Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz as part of the [XPrag.de](https://www.xprag.de/) project [Exhaustiveness in embedded questions across languages](https://www.xprag.de/?page_id=4791) under supervison of [Edgar Onea](https://homepage.uni-graz.at/de/edgar.onea-gaspar/). In my dissertation, I studied on the one hand, the exhaustivity of embedded questions. On the other hand, I investigated the distribution of German *wh*-words in embedded questions under different embedding verbs and compared *who*- and *which*-qestions with respect to their D-linking properties.

Further topics I have conducted research on include the German prefield-*es*, scalar implicatures and experimental methodology.
